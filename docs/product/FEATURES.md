- **Legal / contact:** Coast to Coast Visual Arts Association, 4 – 8800 Hazelbridge Way, Richmond, BC V6X 0S3, `info@ccvaa.ca`
- **Public site:** marketing homepage
- **Private admin:** `/admin` console

---

## Public site (`/`)

**Page order (top → bottom):** Nav → Hero → Membership (`#membership`) → About (`#about`) → Contact (`#contact`) → Footer.

### Header / nav
- Fixed overlay header; style switches when scrolling past hero
- Brush wordmark logos: `logo-ondark.png` (hero) / `logo-onlight.png` (scrolled)
- Subtitle: “Visual Arts Association”
- Nav anchors: Membership (`#membership`), About (`#about`), Contact (`#contact`)

### Hero
- Full-bleed coastal hero image (`hero-background.webp`)
- Eyebrow, headline, subheadline from `src/lib/site.ts`
- Text is non-selectable
- **Subscribe** button anchors to `#contact` (newsletter); live subscriber count as a compact (`K`/`M`/`B`) circle badge on the top-right of the button (`newsletter_status = on`)
- **Join** button anchors to `#membership` (Join panel); live paid-member count as a compact (`K`/`M`/`B`) circle badge on the top-right of the button (`membership_status = active`)
- Dual-axis counter labels (“Newsletter subscribers” / “Paid members”) — never conflates mailing list with membership plans; exact counts in CTA `aria-label`; badges use ocean/coral brand contrast (not black-on-white)
- Counts stub to `0` when `DATABASE_URL` / members DB unavailable; homepage still loads (`members-0007`)

### Membership (`#membership`)
- After Hero, before About — no section title/subtitle
- Plans: **Founding** (capped one-time) while seats remain → then **Lifetime** (one-time, fee always > Founding); **Annual** always offered (stores `membership_anniversary` + `next_renewal_at` from Stripe)
- Logged out → tabs **Sign in** (default, left) | **Join** (right) — only the active form is shown. **Join**: no form title/subtitle; offered plans in a responsive two-column grid (stacks on narrow screens); name, email, optional newsletter opt-in → **one** email OTP → Stripe Checkout → webhook activates; Join+newsletter opt-in does not send a second confirm mail — Contact-only subscribe stays double opt-in; return `/?joined=1&session_id=…#membership` auto-establishes member session → profile. **Sign in**: 6-digit login OTP → httpOnly session. Logged in → compact **profile** summary (name/email edit on demand with email OTP re-verify; Annual shows read-only anniversary / next renewal; no future-perks placeholder or `/admin` note). Newsletter stays in Contact.
- APIs: `GET /api/members/join/plans`, `POST /api/members/join/{start,verify,session}`, `POST /api/members/webhooks/stripe` (idempotent); profile: `GET /api/members/profile`, `PATCH /api/members/profile/name`, `POST /api/members/profile/email/{start,verify}`. Fail closed without Stripe/`DATABASE_URL`/session secrets. Race-safe Founding seat claim.

### About (`#about`)
- Intro paragraphs
- **Our Board** (collapsible section): group photo placeholder stays visible; member cards show name/role always; section expand reveals all portraits + bio placeholders together (Zhong Liu / President, Yaqi Jing / VP, Albert Zang / Secretary; 1:1 portraits)
- **Our Purposes** (collapsible): 10 purpose cards; titles always visible; descriptions toggle together

### Contact (`#contact`)
- Email + mailing address card
- **Newsletter** (orthogonal to paid membership): tabs **Subscribe** | **Unsubscribe** (Membership-like chrome; one panel visible). Subscribe requires **name** + email with double opt-in (Resend OTP); international-friendly name Zod (`personNameSchema`) shared with Join/profile. Unsubscribe: email + control only (no preference lookup) — backend messages for subscribed→off, already off, unknown; never cancels membership. Tokenized one-click `/?unsub=<token>#contact` opens Unsubscribe tab, prefills email, auto-redeems (idempotent). ESP sync stub until provider chosen — see [`docs/members/esp.md`](../members/esp.md). APIs: `POST /api/members/newsletter/{subscribe,confirm,preference,unsub}`.

### Footer
- Org name, tagline, copyright (no duplicate contact block)

### Branding / assets
- Favicon: `src/app/icon.svg` (cream C + teal wave on forest green)
- Theme: coastal fog/forest palette in `globals.css` (ocean + driftwood tokens)
- Logo wave: ocean teal (not gold); on-light wordmark text is brown

---

## Admin (`/admin`)

### Access control
- `robots: noindex` on admin page
- Available on phone, tablet, and desktop

### Layout (left sidebar)
- Dark ocean nav (`ocean-950`): left sidebar on `md+`; on small screens brand + **collapsed menu toggle** (expands to full nav list); cream main pane
- Brand mark (logo + “Visual Arts Association”) shared with public header via `BrandMark` — same logo size (`h-7` / `sm:h-8`), centered
- Nav order: **Webmail**, **Members**, **Events**, **Financial**
- Members / Events / Financial require mailbox sign-in; **Log out** when authenticated
- Main pane shows the active panel (Webmail embed, Members roster, or scaffold placeholders)

### Webmail
- Full-pane Hover webmail via same-origin proxy `/admin/mail` (iframe; Hover blocks direct embed via `X-Frame-Options`)
- Proxy handles Roundcube paths/cookies/CSRF, auth `postMessage` bridge, task switches, and minor chrome fixes
- Known fragility: third-party Roundcube reverse proxy (session/cookie/browser differences)

### Admin auth (Hover mailbox session)
- Admin chrome is authenticated **iff** the Hover mailbox session in the mail iframe is logged in
- Detection: Roundcube session cookie + fail-closed upstream probe (`/api/admin/session`); iframe `postMessage` while Webmail is open
- Sidebar **Log out** clears proxied Roundcube cookies and remounts the mail iframe
- Privilege = anyone who can sign into `info@ccvaa.ca` via embedded webmail

### Members roster
- Mail-session gated roster at **Members** (same Hover login as Webmail)
- List / search by name or email; **plan** and **newsletter** filters are separate axes
- Table shows plan, membership status, newsletter flag; **Annual** rows show anniversary date and next renewal
- Edit (modal + confirm) and delete (confirm dialog); mutations validated with Zod; API routes under `/api/admin/members`
- Fail closed when `DATABASE_URL` is missing or Neon schema is unmigrated (503) — UI shows error state

### Post-auth scaffolds (placeholders only)
- **Events** — coming soon
- **Financial** — coming soon

## Members (planned)

> Work IDs: [`backlogs/members-BACKLOG.md`](backlogs/members-BACKLOG.md). Shipped behavior lands in Public / Admin sections above as items complete.

**Two orthogonal axes:** Newsletter (Contact `#contact`) ⊥ Membership (Founding / Lifetime / Annual on `#membership`). A paid member may or may not be on the newsletter.

| | Newsletter | Membership |
|--|------------|------------|
| **Meaning** | Mailing-list opt-in | Paid association (Stripe) |
| **UI** | Contact tabs Subscribe \| Unsubscribe; ESP unsub → `#contact` Unsubscribe tab + token | `#membership`: Sign-in \| Join tabs ↔ compact profile |
| **Count** | Anyone with newsletter on | Active paid plans |

**Hero:** Subscribe / Join with compact (`K`/`M`/`B`) circle count badges on each CTA (top-right; exact counts in `aria-label`) → `#contact` / `#membership` (anchors).
**Stack:** Neon + Drizzle + Zod · Stripe · Resend · ESP · Mailosaur. Admin roster (`0008`); Resend/ESP new-tab links (`0010`); later: in-admin blast, member perks, impersonation.  
**Standing:** No Resend/ESP iframes; member auth = email OTP (no OAuth/passwords); homepage SPA anchors over separate marketing routes.

**Platform (members-0001, epic `feat/members`):** Drizzle schema on Neon — orthogonal `newsletter_status` vs `membership_plan`; OTP challenges; unsub tokens; `stripe_webhook_events` for Join idempotency. Annual plans use `membership_anniversary` + `next_renewal_at` (null for Founding/Lifetime). Shared Zod in `src/lib/members/zod/`. `GET /api/members/health` fails closed (503) without `DATABASE_URL` (Stripe/Resend status informational). Migrate/seed: `npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:seed` (seeds non-Production only). Schema notes: [`docs/members/schema.md`](../members/schema.md).

**Newsletter (members-0003, epic `feat/members`):** Contact `#contact` UI + `POST /api/members/newsletter/*` routes. Tabs **Subscribe** | **Unsubscribe** (`members-0021`). Subscribe requires name + email; double opt-in via Resend OTP; pending does not count toward subscriber count. Name validation: shared `personNameSchema` (Unicode letters/marks, spaces, common punctuation — `members-0017`). Unsubscribe is email-only (no lookup step); distinct outcomes for off / already off / unknown. Token unsub `/?unsub=<token>#contact` (idempotent; lands on Unsubscribe tab with email + result; membership unchanged). ESP sync stub in `src/lib/members/esp.ts` — footer URL: [`docs/members/esp.md`](../members/esp.md). Requires `DATABASE_URL` + `RESEND_*` for live subscribe; fails closed without them.

**Join / Stripe (members-0004, epic `feat/members`):** `#membership` Join UI + Stripe Checkout (test keys on Dev/Preview). Flow: name/email/optional newsletter opt-in → single `email_verify` OTP → Checkout → `checkout.session.completed` webhook activates membership. Success return includes Stripe `session_id`; `POST /api/members/join/session` mints the same httpOnly member cookie as login (**members-0014**; polls while webhook pending). When newsletter was opted in at Join, webhook sets newsletter `on` from that verified email (**members-0015** — no second Resend confirm). Contact-only subscribe remains double opt-in. Pre-cap Founding+Annual; post-cap Lifetime+Annual. Env: `STRIPE_*`, `MEMBERSHIP_FOUNDING_CAP`, fee cents (Lifetime > Founding enforced). Webhook: `POST /api/members/webhooks/stripe`. Live keys: `members-0009`.

**Member auth (members-0005, epic `feat/members`):** `#membership` login wall — email → 6-digit OTP (`purpose=login` via Resend) → httpOnly signed cookie `ccvaa_member_session` (7-day TTL). Logout clears cookie only (does not touch Hover admin). Active paid members only (`membership_status=active`, plan ≠ none). APIs: `POST /api/members/login/{start,verify,logout}`, `GET /api/members/login/session`. Zod on payloads; OTP rate limits/expiry in `otp-config` / [`docs/members/schema.md`](../members/schema.md). Requires `DATABASE_URL` + `RESEND_*` + `MEMBER_SESSION_SECRET`; fails closed without them. **Never grants `/admin`.**

**Member profile (members-0006, epic `feat/members`):** Logged-in `#membership` face — name edit; email change requires `email_verify` OTP on the new address before DB update; Annual shows read-only `membership_anniversary` + `next_renewal_at` (null/hidden for Founding/Lifetime); light perks placeholder (`members-0012`). APIs: `GET /api/members/profile`, `PATCH /api/members/profile/name`, `POST /api/members/profile/email/{start,verify}`. Zod on profile payloads; session cookie refreshed after identity updates. Requires active member session + `DATABASE_URL` + `RESEND_*`; fails closed without them. No newsletter UI here.

## Infra & ops

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Production | https://ccvaa-web.vercel.app/ (`main`) — agent QA Pass 2 |
| Public domain | https://ccvaa.ca/ — **CEO manual only**; out of agent Dev/QA flow |
| Preview | Per-branch/PR Vercel URL (pre-merge QA target) |
| DNS / email | Hover |
| CI | lint, typecheck, build (GitHub Actions) |
| Stack | Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind; admin auth = Hover mail-session; Members DB = Neon + Drizzle (`DATABASE_URL`) |
| Ship path | Feature branch → QA Preview → merge → cleanup → QA on `ccvaa-web.vercel.app` (Verifier = `agent`). **Epic/milestone (opt-in):** shared branch; Pass 1 per ticket; merge only on **merge milestone**. **Verifier = `ceo`:** CEO verifies (defaults: `direct-to-main` + Production pass2). Work IDs `{feature-slug}-{NNNN}` — [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md). **Baseline** pass = Production audit with no PR. See `docs/protocols/GIT_DEPLOY.md`. CEO may manually check `ccvaa.ca`. |

### Important technical notes for Developer
- Next.js 16: prefer `proxy.ts` over deprecated `middleware.ts`
- Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before novel Next APIs
- Never commit `.env.local` or secrets
- Default: feature branch + PR with backlog work ID `{feature-slug}-{NNNN}`; merge/push `main` only when CEO asks (product Dev). **agent-os** after **`verified`:** PM ships same turn.
- Admin mail proxy on Preview needs network reachability to `mail.hover.com`

## Known gaps / next candidates

Work-to-do lives in **[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)** (feature files under `backlogs/`). Do not duplicate long lists here.

---

## Changelog (high level)

**Order (required):** rows **descending by date** (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Same-day rows: newest event first. Month-only folds (`YYYY-MM`) sit **after** all dated rows in that month. Keep rows **one line** each. When the table grows past ~30 rows, PM may fold older entries into a single monthly summary row (history remains in git). New entries always go at the **top** of their date group (usually the top of the table).
